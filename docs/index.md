## 🔍 Key Questions

- Which Toronto neighborhoods have the highest average prices?
- How do prices vary by room type (entire home, private room, shared room)?
- Are there seasonal revenue trends in the short-term rental market?
- Where might new hosts find profitable opportunities?

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Bay Street Corridor**, **Woodbine-Lumsden**, and **High Park-Swansea** show the highest nightly rates.
- **Shared rooms**, though rare, command surprisingly high average prices.
- Revenue spikes in **May 2025**, suggesting strong spring/summer booking behavior.
